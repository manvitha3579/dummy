# Affine Ciphere
## Aim
To implement Affine Cipher

## Purpose
The Affine Cipher ia an algorithm used for Encryption & Decryption

## Short description
- Affine cipher is actually the multiplicative cipher combined with the Caesar cipher.
- The affine cipher needs two keys: 
    - Multiplicative cipher multiplication 
    - Caesar cipher addition.
- In the affine cipher program, we will split a single integer into two keys.
- **Libraries:**
    - `ascii_lowercase` Module
    - `SystemRandom` Module
    - `random` Module
    
## Workflow
- The complete process depends on length of the alphabets used.
- The letters of an alphabet of size m are first mapped to the integers in the range 0 … m-1.
- The ‘key’ for the Affine cipher consists of 2 numbers, let's call them a and b. The following discussion assumes the use of a 26 character alphabet (m = 26). a should be chosen to be relatively prime to m (i.e. a should have no factors in common with m).

|A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|I|J|K|L|M|N|O|P|Q|R|S|T|U|V|W|X|Y|Z|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|13|14|15|16|17|18|19|20|21|22|23|24|25|

- **Encryption:**
- `E ( x ) = ( a x + b ) mod m` 
    - Here,
        - modulus m is size of the alphabet
        - a and b are keys of the cipher.
        - a must be chosen such that a and m are coprime.
        
- **Decryption:**
- `D ( x ) = a^-1 ( x - b ) mod m`
    - Here,
        - a^-1 is modular multiplicative inverse of a modulo m. i.e., it satisfies the equation 1 = a a^-1 mod m .

## Compilation Steps
 - Download the file Affine_Ciphere.py

- Run the file Affine_Cipher.py

- Input the message you want encrypt or decrypt.

- Input any key
- Choose any mode
    - Encrypt
    - Decrypt
